      The giant panda, also known as the panda bear, is a bear species endemic to China.
      Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
      Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity,
      they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
