      The orca or killer whale is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family. 
      A cosmopolitan species, orcas can be found in all of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.
      Orcas have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, 
      while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin. 
      They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Orcas are apex predators, as they have no natural predators.
