      The Hedgehog is a small spiny mamal of the subfamily Erinaceinae.
      Hedgehogs share a common ancestor with shrews and the species have changed little over the last fifteen million years. 
      Like many of the first mammals, they are nocturnal.
      There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera found throughout parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand.
      hedgehogs are omnivorous. They feed on insects, snails, frogs and toads, snakes, bird eggs, carrion, mushrooms, grass roots, berries, melons and watermelons.
